- 1. need to turn off gpg
- 2.

wha possibilities are there.

- disable fully
- cronjo
- solve bug
- ask dannymat if he uses neogit.

`git-remotes`

walk through the command

1. test it on ghq
2. does this work with "others" repos
3. do I have to add forks to my own user?
4. fork nest.nvim > add connor remote and make sure his branch is available
5. use the local nest branch.

if this would work with the regular ghq structure and I can  just add
remotes to my own forks when they have been added to my system that would
be ideal. maybe it would be possible to use the save command to
store all remotes in the exporst list that would be the ideal thing in my
case I believe.

---------------------------------------------------------

>>> OVERRIDE CMP <<<

Yeah go for it, if you wanted you could copy the lua/doom/modules/features/lsp
to lua/user/modules/lsp and make any changes you want there.  I'm pretty sure
everything will work.

TODO: try this and just duplicate the lsp module.

OR try this according to docs:

```lua
--- config.lua

local lsp = doom.modules.lsp
local old_nvim_cmp_config_function = lsp.configs['nvim-cmp']
lsp.configs['nvim-cmp'] = function()
  old_nvim_cmp_config_function() -- Run the default config
  local cmp = require("cmp") -- direct access to plugin
end
```

---------------------------------------------------------

create helper that adds appropriate package keys.


add_package
add_telescope_extension

---------------------------------------------------------

move my binds helper to user/utils. this way I can keep all of my heplers in there.

what is this
------------------------------------------

see if it is possible to keep all operator changing mappings in one module and then see if it works.
otherwise it has to be done "first" but first see if that is even necessary.

------------------------------------------

what are all options defaults? possibilities?

ask connor does nest use nvim-mapper to create the binds or is this done in nvim-mapper?

look at the mapping util.

------------------------------------------

this is what she called terror which is something that is quite scary. a walking
safari post and counter phase which is the decisional phase. we know that this is a
potential phase.

down down down magen magen magen magen andas djupt andas djupt andas djupt ner i
magen ner i magen and transport connected workers will probably do that on monday.
visit the capital of ukrain which is kiev.

in the international journal of psychiatry.

planboken disables them to sell and do shit like they do but many people get
much less than what they would have thought they should get.
it is not something that you might ever want to do.

it sais fruit on all of these products but it is not. they lie all of the time.
and so that is something that is not very nice. and so that is what makes it
into ultra processed stuff. a lot of exxx numbers are completely natural but
some of these are not very good at all and. the small silver things that you
can see on a birthday cake or something so that is something quite interesting.

this is fucing insane and i want to get out of this shit.

and the weapons indursty. the water was in a light shade of brown that did not
make me feel good at all and so later when we were to split the lobster
shells it didn't really work at all but we tried and concluded that it is impossible.

by mailing you with snail mail which is a bit insane. I mean validation of a string

now this is very interesting. the nazi death camps are good contenders. normal
human processes. we know that we can pretty much get them to do anything.
underlings.

iw ill he could have gone something funny instead of just fucking out straight which
was super boring. you know. fuck you you bitch. that is a style choice.
now it is not going to happen much more since it is something that is quite fucking
strang lukeemea which is another disease rogain alopesia.

he is in philly and wants to burn bridges tonight

ghq backup script

investigate how I can store remotes information so that it is easy to
bring them back and get back all of the information.

this is all going to become quite easy when this is all brought out.
and my commands thingy is stupid. but it is a fun experiment for learning
about algorhithms and stuf and mix files so it is something that is quite useful
from a user interaction perspective. later when the reloader module and
everything works and you can move shit from one level to the other.
then it is a really nice system.

and then later I am going to master the nvim terminal so that I can run things
fast as lightning from within the system and so that is one of the nicest things.
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz.

i need to get the snippets plugin to work. and when the shit is working in it.
so the bindings are so important. so that you can really map that shit
from outside of the module. nicotine is a hard fucking drug that fucks you
up dude. no it wasn't that hard. but you have to understand what I did before
I quite that made it easy.

that is a lot for somebody who doesn't say it often.
so this is very interesting alopesia and that is quite fucking interesting and I am now
going to see how it feels to do this with the computer in various positions so that I can
stretch and workout in the same space.

so that is a bit funny. so when this is working I am going to start working on
how to do more complex things with this is fucking insane and so that is the most
dumbest thing ever.

i am not going to do this now but the key syntax will only make sense if
I understand how the nest plug works so that I don't build something stupid.
