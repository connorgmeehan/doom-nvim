there is absolutely no gain back to the one who does the work with it. i don't fucking understand why the fuck they do that shit.
why are you fucking doing that.

yes and max. wow this is just amazing and os that is something that you cannot really do that fast and the thing that istrostaros
but how the fuck can you do that shit even if it is so fast that the thing that we do there is just going to fuck itself.

everyone is there to help their own which is quite fucking insane.

mix fix or my translator in ukrain is very care free with saying the same thing so tha is fucking amazing so that they fucking understand
tha they cannot fucking do the shit tha they are doing.

i interviewed this for my substack and so this is one of the most important things that i have ever learnt and so this is the best fucking
shit that i have ever seen. which is fucking wild sebastian younger in tribes in these developed intense bonds with people with
people that they have been in intense fights with extreme situations life and death is a daily experience fabric and when that doesn't
happen there is a certain section of society that seeks conflicts in the most proposterous ways pronouns outrage de jour. bes state
when we are in some kind of life or death situation quote that more or less expresses what you are saying.

before ukrain happened i was talking to some friend about this shit and we were chuckling about it. so that these fucking blue hairs
understand tha their fucking bullshit doesn't mean a damn thing.

here is the other thing that i would say so the one thing that is wierd about talking. not just protestant christianity.
it and so somehow that for obvious judeism. the wonkey term.

so that is something that is quite cool you know. and i know that this guy could do that and also think about it since he did the things for
the main system which is something that is quite fucking crazy and you never know why that can happen. it is something thaty ou might never
want to run. but i mean essentially that is the thing that we need to fucking do madisson cathorn.

and that affects us incredibly much which is insane and you never understand how this can be taught which is something that you might
never have to do which is one of the most insane things. he is so convinced about their roll that their and so that is something that
is rightfully theirs which is something that you might never understand. they wash their information along the way which is crazy
but also

is this one of the systems that they want to use for that or is it one of those things that they could bring to use like a master
you know. why the fuckg would they bring that shit out and fucking say that.

either three meters long or fucking one twenty and so that is fucking retarded and so that makes it so that they need to be
on their watch all the time. always.

that led people to believe that and so now i know that decimate is about ten percent and so that is from jeff pilkington and that
would make more sense for both parties and so that is something that is quite fucking annoying because.

ingenting and so here is something that I read about him today and so LA robberies that involve fire arms have increased about
forty five percent in the last years. and so that is fucking insane. and so i understand that and so it is completely natural.

everyone on the otherside will just say shit like this. did armed robbery go up like this.

i understand it and it is something that you can fucking retardedly see. this is not the thing that they feel about. so the trainee guide.
