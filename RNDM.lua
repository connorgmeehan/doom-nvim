- 1. need to turn off gpg
- 2.

wha possibilities are there.

- disable fully
- cronjo
- solve bug
- ask dannymat if he uses neogit.


--------

`git-remotes`

walk through the command

1. test it on ghq
2. does this work with "others" repos
3. do I have to add forks to my own user?
4. fork nest.nvim > add connor remote and make sure his branch is available
5. use the local nest branch.

if this would work with the regular ghq structure and I can  just add
remotes to my own forks when they have been added to my system that would
be ideal. maybe it would be possible to use the save command to
store all remotes in the exporst list that would be the ideal thing in my
case I believe.

---------------------------------------------------------

>>> OVERRIDE CMP <<<

Yeah go for it, if you wanted you could copy the lua/doom/modules/features/lsp
to lua/user/modules/lsp and make any changes you want there.  I'm pretty sure
everything will work.

TODO: try this and just duplicate the lsp module.

OR try this according to docs:

```lua
--- config.lua

local lsp = doom.modules.lsp
local old_nvim_cmp_config_function = lsp.configs['nvim-cmp']
lsp.configs['nvim-cmp'] = function()
  old_nvim_cmp_config_function() -- Run the default config
  local cmp = require("cmp") -- direct access to plugin
end
```

---------------------------------------------------------

create helper that adds appropriate package keys.


add_package
add_telescope_extension

---------------------------------------------------------

move my binds helper to user/utils. this way I can keep all of my heplers in there.

---------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim

what is this
------------------------------------------

see if it is possible to keep all operator changing mappings in one module and then see if it works.
otherwise it has to be done "first" but first see if that is even necessary.

------------------------------------------

what are all options defaults? possibilities?

ask connor does nest use nvim-mapper to create the binds or is this done in nvim-mapper?

look at the mapping util.

------------------------------------------

look at simon's recommndations for data analysis plugins and create a module for doom
so that it can easilly be reused again.

------------------------------------------

TEST COMMAND WITH ARGUMENTS <<<<<<<<<<
HOW IS THIS DONE IN GTD NEORG?

------------------------------------------

fix the paths module so that you update paths efficiently.

[packer.nvim] [ERROR 12:03:15] async.lua:20: Error in coroutine: ...ite/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim/lua/packer/compile.lua:652: attempt to index a nil value

it is like a racist sexist thing to say so that is quite fucking strange
it is a turtle banging on his chest because she sais things that are so absurd that it is hard to follow her ideas sometimes.
but why are we giving them three billion dollars i am asking myself?

let's take one of the most amazing things every ou know that is actually much harder that you might think it is.

you can find a poll for anything so that is not very strange. freshly forty the puertorican rattlesnake and so good good.
so now let's have a fun show.

let's fall down and make this shit which is something that you might never understand and the reason why this is is because that
is something that you might never ever understand. draw a basketball rworded rworded as fworded. he is nworded as fuck.
how did I subsist withing are you out of your fucking mind. grind it around the screw. hexagon.

bourbon this is getting good and so that is one of the most amazing things that you can ever imagine. matt mccuskar.
and the dog that you hate. what are you talking about. how about you take the base out of your voice when you talk to big jay.
after you made the bet you saw us play. naha. talk shit and come get some. even though you are making excellent points I am
on jay and luis' side luis tried to fist fight shane in the middle of the fight. i said fucked up shit i am going to get knocked
out by luis j gomez. i am too real ass. they really did loose twelve to zero which is just pathetic.

try callong my yabai scripts from. this could become quite amazing actually and so it makes nothing into the reason why they don't do that
and so nothing can be said to you that mimics this behaior.

winter came back. that is a bit strange and it will be interesting to hear what this will do to nature and stuff. i am really going to be
so fucking incredibly interested in what that does.

this is going to be so much fun because I had never thought this would be possible to do in neovim. terminal and that is something
and what is the argument against that one. dude when i am done now this is going to be so much fucking fun and this system looks
so fucking nice. i am here to take questions from you covid didn't come from a lab.

it is all of the above so that something will happen and the thing for that is that they never ever fucking did that shit and so why
would they even look into that shit. in order to see if they have the ability to learn this type of stuff or not.

teaching farmers how to use facebook. he is trying to stay balanced but he is doing a very bad job. it makes me quite fucking sad
and so that is the thing that really makes it so you cannot really make sure this is what goes on.

so he posed this questino. i know that i will become a monster if I can only get out of this shit. it is the most important thing
ever and that is just such a help. regarding people who are closer and so he said the same thing for conny who is a truck
driver and there is such an insane piple of that and so that is one of the most insane things that you can ever do.
the country with the highest tax cap in the world sais this is something that would make sense you know and that is the reason why
they do that shit you know.

i should try the refactor plugin on the reloader module and see how it feels. maybe it would work to use it for just moving chunks

into smaller functions that would be nice and so that is something that is quite cool.

this is just so fuckying cool because niow everything is done at eye focus which means that you never have to do any kind of annoying
unergonomic movements for your neck.

you have to think right in order to hae a good outcome so you cant stop thinking about something negative.

it is when you buy shit that it makes you into something that is quite fucking retraded and the thing that is wiffed away
from the discussion and that is a thing that.

this is a bit annoying and that is going to make you feel like shit which is something that is a bit hard to expect but that side
won't ever fucking roll with this and it is abit fucking annoying

i have woken up so early. that it is really annoying and I feel absolutely destroyed and it is not very nice at all right now so
we will see what it becmoes but I am so fucking stressed out right now that it is not fun to talk about.

enough nurses so that they cannot really do the health duties that they need to do.
wimab whih monoclonal antibodies into muscles and so paxlovid and introduction into subcutanious issue.

quite disturbing and they were getting money and if you get a should you should take it because these things are quite amazing
and I have used it on a lot of patients and then you should call this number.

A. NEXT STEP IS TO USE REFACTOR PLUGIN TO MAKE THE RELOADER MODULE INTO AS SMALL FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU CAN REUSE
ANYTHING IF YOU'D LIKE.

B. TEST EDITORCONFIG ON DOROTHY

read outs from these trials and so that is hopeful that these platforms are well understood now and so that is something that you might
really do. comic strip bloggers. i wonder how hard it would be to add support for trunk to vim.
one of the guys and I were really good friends.

i wonder why this is and why it is so fucking slow now that I am testing this this morning.
how does this feel right now. well that is quite fucking crazy and I don't understand how this is fucking possible.
because now things are starting to work really well and that is why this is just so fucking cool and why the things they look
at pretty much don't work you know. each morning the president of the usa recieves a presidents daily brief.

i need to use playground and see how it works with treesitter so that I can really start to appreciate how one can use ts to
manage all of your code easilly.

you are not going to fucing touch my animals then they are going to get fucked. you cannot just let anybody come and steal your
stuff. and i know all the city people aren't the same. why do they mock and make fun of country people.

i like smart systems you know. up in the scyscraper complexes.

you seem like a reasonable person.

they also have a whole lot of gun crime. when i hear illinoi. chiraq

what is the penalty for violating the stature this stuff the average person i know what they are forcing on me is fucking wierd
and it is not always gonna work out for you sounds like the evidence that you accrued.

or twenty or twentyfive kilometers per hour, and so a pedestrian. but if I am a bicyclist then it is fucking hard.

crypto currency intregration. that signal does their thing as an inspirational source probably is more probable given how they work.

so you could use any xmtp client in order to use them but now it is not possible anymore. okay so how does it feel now when I type.
well this is going to hurt quite a lot. let me take a look at one of the videos. you are in my house you fucking bitch as cunt.
rr. it is difficult to retell something like this because of how the memory works.

that is a continous problem that we have to look into a bit so that something can be come good you know.

digital andacts and then it would be appropriate if people could do that at home and also do that shit.

this is actually very cool and I believe that we can actualy do this which is smoething that is much harder that this shit you know.

twenty fucing five and this is quite fucking insane and so that is the reason why you do this shit.

what would you have done that shit and so that is something thaty ou don't really watching that was a bit wierd because I don't know
him and I don't think that it is fake at all. we just released one on biden and so that is quite fucking funny extraspicy.
eleven pm eastern time. it feels like this has to be the fucking key dude. everyone has got teir fucking zenue thingy around the
planet and this makes it so that you cannot really fucking doshit

with a weaker payment ability which is something that is quite fucki disturbing.

swedish economy is rolling in an okay fashion but it is going to e difficult to do that thing which makes it super hard and champy.

the compromise that she is thinking about seems to be one of the things that they will never fucking do.

how does it feel now to type and so hm and zara has some kind of boycot and so we don't know how to get a way in at the moment.
agneta wijkman menar. the police is awaited to double their manpower when it comes to executing passports so that people can get their
identifiational documents. people like you are rare. so intellectuals and people who think that free speesh is one of the most important
aspects of life. certain direction hey what the fuck is going on.

likne the then you don't have to fear anything at all which is quite fucking insane.

it is not the most important thing that I would ever do you know so that would be something that is.

towards his networth and this is quite a fucking lot and we don't understand why this shit is and so fifty bucks is quite
interesting you know. i would also kill my dog if it was attacking children whom I know or don't know.

why is it not loading properly. that is quite annoying and it really pisses me off. a million strangers or the million people.
what do you mean. god allowed his child to die for the nation to survive.
