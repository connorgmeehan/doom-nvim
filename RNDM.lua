- 1. need to turn off gpg
- 2.

wha possibilities are there.

- disable fully
- cronjo
- solve bug
- ask dannymat if he uses neogit.


--------

`git-remotes`

walk through the command

1. test it on ghq
2. does this work with "others" repos
3. do I have to add forks to my own user?
4. fork nest.nvim > add connor remote and make sure his branch is available
5. use the local nest branch.

if this would work with the regular ghq structure and I can  just add
remotes to my own forks when they have been added to my system that would
be ideal. maybe it would be possible to use the save command to
store all remotes in the exporst list that would be the ideal thing in my
case I believe.

---------------------------------------------------------

>>> OVERRIDE CMP <<<

Yeah go for it, if you wanted you could copy the lua/doom/modules/features/lsp
to lua/user/modules/lsp and make any changes you want there.  I'm pretty sure
everything will work.

TODO: try this and just duplicate the lsp module.

OR try this according to docs:

```lua
--- config.lua

local lsp = doom.modules.lsp
local old_nvim_cmp_config_function = lsp.configs['nvim-cmp']
lsp.configs['nvim-cmp'] = function()
  old_nvim_cmp_config_function() -- Run the default config
  local cmp = require("cmp") -- direct access to plugin
end
```

---------------------------------------------------------

create helper that adds appropriate package keys.


add_package
add_telescope_extension

---------------------------------------------------------

move my binds helper to user/utils. this way I can keep all of my heplers in there.

---------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim

what is this
------------------------------------------

see if it is possible to keep all operator changing mappings in one module and then see if it works.
otherwise it has to be done "first" but first see if that is even necessary.

------------------------------------------

what are all options defaults? possibilities?

ask connor does nest use nvim-mapper to create the binds or is this done in nvim-mapper?

look at the mapping util.

------------------------------------------

look at simon's recommndations for data analysis plugins and create a module for doom
so that it can easilly be reused again.

------------------------------------------

TEST COMMAND WITH ARGUMENTS <<<<<<<<<<
HOW IS THIS DONE IN GTD NEORG?

------------------------------------------

they need to be put in very secure storage facilities so that you don't cause somekind of massive accident so that it is something
that you might very well be there for.

this is pretty nice

it is written in fennel.

where the edge of this country is going so that you can make shit into something that is quite fucking strange.

fix the paths module so that you update paths efficiently.

READ:

TODO: fix paths and formatting module. move code format to leader>code>format>all

this is quite fucking amazing and now I am starting to understand how fast this shit can actually work in the terminal and jump around
faster than a motherfucker. but it is good because everything is extremely well organized in a way that makes it possible for you
to really learn how to really do shit nicely.

it has to be faster than a motherfucker and so that is just so fucking insane that you cannot really understand it at all.
which would be quite insane and the reason why that is is because that is just such a motherfucker of a system.

so that he can start in a tiny school now. and so that is just fucking insane you know.
for allegedly violating their own policy which is a bit insane since they never do anything to show it to the other side and so
does this matter well that is the question.

stenography is quite interesting. always being honest and so that would be quite interesting so that you can embed it wherever you are.

firenvim > nyxt embedd extension? so that you can really do everything in a vim style fashion.
sit in the stool you motherfucker dumbass cucksucker.

so that you can have modules just as dummy note dumps so that you can just dump if you come up with something that you think about.
stephen monacielly because he was mad  at he fact that this woman said that they were going to email my employer and tell them
that I am an evil racist which determinnes by the next coming word. internal manouvering so that it doen't really make anything that
is heavy consequences since i have talked about this since this morning. willing to uuh stand u and let the consequences fuck this
shit up. that is a thing that people need to understand and so that is something that you must have all gotten sick from.

now that I undersand this. even that among he employees could cause insane trouble since it doesn't ever do anything that is like
that. whenever there is a layoff everyone has to hold a potato so that constantly and no one catches it then it is you.

it does not work at all as how I would like it to. did he have the right to shoot his guy since they are taking my son and
there we are not giving up the kid. you kidnapped my child and I am here with a court order. incredibly frustrating and you
have the right to be with your son if your children are being parentally kidnapped.

split squats is the bes thing that I have ever done since it really fucking makes me stronger and so that is really fucking cool.

now after a couple of years I am starting to understand how they work. bogdanoff twins.

press from the opposition which needs to act now so that nothing stupid happens in the case of an emergency.

start walking through code of all treesitter and lsp plugins so that I can learn how to become a super pro.

i didn't have anyone who I could talk to so that is why this did never make any sense which is quite fucking retarded.

and I need to have a better local dev environment. so the next step.

print everything in the reload file and see how it works.

i think log dot debug is what should run. so that if I set debug it will run all of the logs that I assign so that I can understand
what is actually going on in the code. in haninge which makes it more important to communicate with them so that we can really.
do this shit and

print treesitter stuff and see what happens so that it can be nicely utils.

this is pretty fucking cool. so that is what you get when you write it which is pretty damn cool and that is something that really
works well.

that is pretty fucking cool and it all combines very well into vim. so how good can this become from an ergonomC perspective

this is also interesting because it creates like a completely new ui for nvim that has a super cool ui and borders and all
kinds of cool shit. we were all essentially squating in this place which made it quite fucking funny so that the reason why they
did that is not the same as why they ran up there so that you can build in and make things make it like that.

because when everything is done at eye sight then you feel amazing when you type and code and this is what makes it possible.

one of our favorite sponsors tha realy give us magic for christmas  a slap of wood in your mouth and there is something .
live show at the stand tuesday basketball dave donfmt do this shit beats her up just shit talk. i know nothing about this story.
send a signal saying that we are together as a family. they are working hard which is a bit hard so we need to just work on
hard.


CMD: toggle debug log statements so that I can be sure that nvim always starts without any stupid messages.

when this is all done it is going to be so nice to type and create stuff that comes from spacemacs which is a nother cool editor
but I have been using neovim which vim which is just an aweome but difficult tool.

this is like myst level weather outside whether or not they will do that is up to them. if you can even use the word normal.


we are happy here but we know that the shit happens in other places.

we are pretty annoyed with the fact that we don't have to do that shit so something is quite fukcing retarded.

neogit is very nice. so that you can view diffs inside of neovim and so that development has exploded. which is a lot of fun.
yeah. in a more formal fashion but he never sais anything that is actual proof. it is always second or third hand info so it
always becomes very hard to believe.

my soul hurts because I don't want to do that shit which ispo. i am hoping that you are gonna be there we are live from the stand comedy
club the skanks are all here what's up motherfuckers hello I stand with will smith comedians disrespect our wives raped by will smith
smacked hears that story amazing guests tonight hilarious cipha sounds.

convicted kind of and I loved it you know the hardest part was in when I was dosing jay and I laughed so hard oh my god this is
shit hey you buddy okay i get fucked comings heard that song. not only
was it written for chris but it was like jane oh connor all about black women's hair and the most ironic thing is that he
rapped you once in that alley.

so the next paragrah would be that right z

so that you can bring shit out of the window which is something that is quite and that was quite thrilling you know.

how do I write multi arg comands that work with the current api that we are using so that
we can add and don't need to fucking change shitloads of stuff you know.

so that we can do that shit super fast and insanely fast. that is one of the most insane
systems that I have ever heard about and you can run it so fast that it is riddiculous.
