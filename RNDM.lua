so this is a bit annoyin and lf

so i don't know how to handle this actually and so we are heavily developing it at the moment. and so i have been trying to
upgrade my configs now to the new system but it is a bit buggy so it makes me a bit slow at the moment and that is a fucking 
bitch which is quite fucking insane and so that is something that I thought you don't do. I had like a meme stuck in my head that 
one is not suppose to train hip flexors/ not use them. because that is a nlp thing that happens if you do a lot of core work.
when you read a lot about core and you watch videos about it. you get sort of brainwashed with thaty ou are suppose to be cautious 
so that you don't engage your hip flexors and this is quite fucking stupid.

that is just insane dude. and i don't want to do that shit at all and so that is something that i would really like to be able to do 
you know and so that reason why they did that is something that you cannot really do and alsoy ou can also recode everything in lua should 
you want.
